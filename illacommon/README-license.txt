During the build process there is a set of additional libraries downloaded
for building and distribution of the Illarion applications. All libraries
are distributed with a LICENSE.txt file that names the license the libraries
are distributed with. The libraries are found in the lib/ directory. The
corresponding native implementations are found in the native/ directory
sorted by the operating system.
